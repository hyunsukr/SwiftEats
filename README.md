#Swift Eats
##Description
Swift Eats is a Web-application to directly order daily lunch menu items from your personal computer. The data is read in directly from the cafeteria's weekly schedule. 
##Origins
This project was done at Swift during the two day hackathon by Max Ryoo, Megan Gilbert, Frank McKee, Patrick Ellington, and Joseph Cheeks. This was the award winning hackathon project for the hackathon. We all learned a great amount making an developing an API and Web-application
##Future Use
This project can be used for all companies and food places if you maniuplate the data entry to your liking. It was a hackathon project so we did have limitations on time and data. Becuase of the shortness of time the app is still not fully developed. Some problems include...

- Susceptible to SQL injection
- Incomplete connection with data insert method (Hard coded)
- Big sql tables that can be broken down and joined

##Running
This application can be downloaded and ran by doing npm install if you will like the nodemailer and formiable npm packages. If those packages are of no need you can simply write index.js which will start your application on your local address port 1234 (ex 127.0.0.1:1234). This application was tested on Unix and does work on any linux machine. Possibly on windos also.
